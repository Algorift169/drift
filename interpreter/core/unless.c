/* Unless execution runs its body when the deferred condition is false. 

unless is a conditional execution form that evaluates a deferred condition and runs its body 
only if the condition evaluates to false. If the condition is true, the body is skipped. However, if
the condition is false, the body is executed. The unless statement is useful for cases where 
you want to execute a block of code only when a certain condition is not met, providing a clear and 
concise way to express negative conditions in your code. It is often used as an alternative to 
if statements when you want to emphasize the negative case, making the code more readable and 
expressive. The unless statement can be used in various programming scenarios, such as input validation,
    error handling, and conditional execution of code blocks based on specific criteria. It allows 
    developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code by reducing the need for nested if 
statements and improving the overall flow of the program. By using unless, you can clearly convey
    the intent of your code, making it easier for others to understand the logic and purpose of the 
    conditional execution. Overall, the unless statement is a valuable addition to the programming 
    language, providing a more expressive and readable way to handle negative conditions in your code.
